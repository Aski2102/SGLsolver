SGLsolver-for-one-dimensional-potential
############################

This project is supposed to solve the one dimensional, time independent 
schrodinger-equation for an arbitrary potential and to create plots of the potential, 
the wave function and other relevant variables.

Further information about the usage of the program can be optained via
sphinx-documentation.
To open the HTML documentation page execute in shell 
(remember to change to the SGLsolver directory):
>>firefox docs/_build/html/index.html<<
Any other webbrowser can be used as well.
